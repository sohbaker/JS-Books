#Books  

Create an application that allows you to use the Google Books API (https://bit.ly/2UeCn7B) to search for books, and deploy it somewhere that can be accessed through a web browser.  

This application should allow you to:  
- [] Type in a query and display a list of books matching that query.  
- [] Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.  
- [] From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.
